# Welcome to The Clause

[Join our gitter chat room!](https://gitter.im/TheClause/community)

The Clause is an initiative to bring Prolog into the modern web development world. Although Prolog is already quite capable, there is work to be done in writing more documentation, resources, and tutorials that are catered towards the web development industry.

This repo is an accumulation of these efforts. Below you will find resources for learning and using Prolog.
